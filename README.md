### Installing OpenFK
OpenFK requires some manual work to set it up fully. 

Put the contents of the OpenFK release into your RadicaGame folder.

You will also need to find the Flash.ocx file, you can run FetchOCX.bat [(Click here to download)](https://github.com/GittyMac/OpenFK/releases/download/v1.5/FetchOCX.bat) in RadicaGame to easily download and extract a compatible version. (Note FetchOCX is only for x64 for now.)

Be sure to run the 'Configure OpenFK.bat' file to choose from some choices!

### How to use USB support.
To use USB support, you will need to have the MegaByte drivers installed. 

Enable USB Support in the OpenFK configuration.

Set MegaByte.exe (Located by RadicaGame in the MegaByte folder) to Vista SP2 compatibility.

Now you can use USB with OpenFK! (customF and USB can work together!)

### Building OpenFK
You can build OpenFK with anything that can build dotNET 4.5 projects, like Visual Studio. You also need to have the ActiveX version of Adobe Flash Player installed to be able to use the 'Shockwave Flash Object' COM component.
