### Installing OpenFK
OpenFK requires some manual work to set it up fully. 

Put the contents of the OpenFK release into your RadicaGame folder.

You will also need to find the Flash.ocx file, it is usually found in the `C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\` directory. Put the Flash.ocx file with your OpenFK.exe file.

Be sure to run the 'Configure OpenFK.bat' file to choose from some choices!

### Building OpenFK
You can build OpenFK with anything that can build dotNET 4.5 projects, like Visual Studio. You also need to have the ActiveX version of Adobe Flash Player installed to be able to use the 'Shockwave Flash Object' COM component.
