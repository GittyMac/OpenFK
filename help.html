        <h3>Common issues and solutions</h3>

        <h2>It says I have no OCX!</h2>
        <p>There will be a popup that will ask you if you want to install Flash.OCX</p>
        <h2>My USB isn't working!</h2>
        <p>Make sure the MegaByte drivers are properly installed and that USB support is enabled in OpenFK.0</p>
        <h2>A game from Paradox Green isn't working properly!</h2>
        <p>Actionscript 3 support is currently fairly experimental, so expect some bugs.</p>
        <h2>I can't go online!</h2>
        <p>There are currently no active servers, so you will have to play offline.</p>
        <h2>The game doesn't look properly scaled!</h2>
        <p>This one is a strange one. The way the game scales is not that good, and will result in some glitches which depends on the resolution. <br> Try using the 'Stretch 4:3' option which will use the original 800x600 resolution.</p>
